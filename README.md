# Angular Multi-component

## Description
That code is an example of how we can share data between components and modules. The propose here is to use a share service that use two way data binding to change a data simultaneously. So, when it is done in a module, it will be reflected on others modules or componentes at the same time. The data share server pattern is a good approach to avoid unnecessary broadcasts or root scope variables.
